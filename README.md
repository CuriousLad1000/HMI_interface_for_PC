**HMI interface for PC**

**Introduction**

Personal Computers have become an integral part of our lives that even thinking about living without one would give us the feeling of falling back into stone age.

The idea behind this project was to build a smart Human Machine Interface for my personal computer. This project provided me with the opportunity of honing my skills while exploring various other domains. This project required technical expertise from different fields of technology including Electronics, Computer Science and Mechanical.

**Project Objective**

The HMI interface will provide some advanced functionalities such as auto boot and shutdown, Automatic Temperature controller, vent controller, Lighting controller etc…

The project will involve some custom hardware designing, PCB fabrication, UX Designing, firmware programming, some mechanical designing and assembly using Rapid prototyping machines.

**Hardware/components used (**not exhaustive list**)**

-   Arduino MEGA
-   3.5-inch Touch panel from Nextion
-   DC to DC Buck-Boost drivers
-   Mosfets (IRFZ44N)
-   various passive components
-   Acryllic and MDF for casing and PC cabinet casing.
-   Laser cutter
-   CNC milling machine

**Software used**

-   Arduino IDE (C/C++)
-   Nextion Editor to program touch panel.
-   Adobe Photoshop for UI designing.
-   Corel draw for Case, side panel and vents designing.
-   Cadsoft Eagle for PCB designing
-   Roland’s software and artcam for PCB fabrication (CNC milling).

**Features offered**

After completion, the HMI interface will have the following features.

-   Provide interactive system on/off switch
-   System Power on scheduler
-   Control the speed of fan based on conditions set.
    -   manual control of fan speed
    -   Automatic control based on the component’s temperature
-   Different Lighting modes for the system across multiple channels
    -   Rainbow
    -   Single color
    -   Fading on single color
    -   Rainbow cycle
    -   Color based on temperature
-   Display current temperature on multiple temperature gauges.
-   Provide settings for additional functionalities such as
    -   Open vents when system boots or based on the temperature -- servo control
    -   Enable power saver
    -   Enable/disable system status LED.
    -   Temperature channel assignment to various components.
